## Overview

Machine learning is often treated as a black box. **ML-Algorithm-Library** demystifies core algorithms by providing pure-Python (+ NumPy) implementations with clear, well-documented code. This fosters deep understanding: inspect every operation, trace the math-to-code mapping, experiment with variations, and extend for your research or production prototypes.

Key goals:
- **Educational clarity**: Code is written & commented to teach intuition as well as implementation details.
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only NumPy and standard library; avoids hiding logic behind heavy frameworks.
- **Consistent interface**: Uniform `fit` / `predict` (or analogous) APIs across models.
- **Modular design**: Organized by category (Regression, Classification, Clustering, etc.), making it easy to extend.
- **Production-awareness**: While focusing on clarity, highlights performance considerations and when to scale up to optimized libraries.

## Installation

This library is lightweight and not currently published to PyPI. You can install directly from GitHub:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/AdilShamim8/ML-Algorithm-Library.git
cd ML-Algorithm-Library

# (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install numpy
# If you plan to run tests or notebooks:
pip install pytest jupyter matplotlib
````

To integrate this library into another project, install in “editable” mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

*(Ensure you have a `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` configured if you choose to support `pip install -e .`.)*

## Usage

### Importing and Running an Algorithm

All algorithms follow a consistent pattern:

```python
from ml_algorithm_library.regression.simple_linear import SimpleLinearReg

# Prepare data
X_train = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y_train = [2, 4, 5, 4, 5]

# Instantiate & fit
model = SimpleLinearReg()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
X_test = [6, 7, 8]
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Predictions:", y_pred)
```

### Example Notebooks

* **Regression Tutorial**: `notebooks/Regression/SimpleLinearRegression.ipynb`

  * Intuition: fitting a line as minimizing squared errors.
  * Code walkthrough: calculating slope/intercept.
  * Visualization: plot data & fitted line.
  * Experiments: add noise, outliers, regularization.

* **Classification Tutorial**: `notebooks/Classification/LogisticRegression.ipynb`

  * Derive sigmoid, loss, gradient descent.
  * Compare with scikit-learn output.
  * Plot decision boundary on synthetic data.

* **Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction**: Similar structure with plots showing cluster assignments, PCA projections.

Use `jupyter notebook` to open and run these demos. They serve both as learning material and quick reference for usage patterns.

## Development & Contributing

Contributions are welcomed! Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and high quality.

### Code Style & Standards

* **PEP 8 compliant**: readable, concise, clear.
* **Docstrings**: Use triple-quoted docstrings. Top-level summary, followed by parameters, returns, and brief explanation of algorithm’s intuition or references.
* **Inline comments**: Explain non-obvious steps (e.g., derivation points, vectorization decisions).
* **Type hints (optional)**: You may include type hints for clarity, but keep code beginner-friendly.
* **Dependencies**: Only NumPy and standard library in core modules. Development dependencies (pytest, jupyter, matplotlib) listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Branching & Workflow

* **Main branch**: Always passing CI, stable.
* **Feature branches**: Branch from `main` named `feature/<algorithm-name>` or `fix/<issue-number>`.
* **Pull Requests**:

  * Base branch: `main`.
  * Provide clear PR title and description: what was added/changed, motivation, references.
  * Link any related issue.
  * Ensure all tests pass locally before opening PR.

### Testing

* Use **pytest**.
* Write tests for new algorithms under `tests/`, e.g., `test_<algorithm>.py`.
* Synthetic datasets: small, deterministic. Validate core functionality and edge cases.
* Run locally: `pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q`.
* CI will run `pytest` on each push/PR; ensure coverage doesn’t drop significantly.

### Continuous Integration

* GitHub Actions config in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Example steps:

  1. Checkout code.
  2. Setup Python (versions: 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10+).
  3. Install dependencies (`pip install numpy pytest`).
  4. Run `pytest`.
  5. (Optional) Report coverage to Codecov.
* Keep CI fast; avoid heavy dependencies in CI. Notebooks are not executed in CI by default (to save time), but code cells can be spot-tested if desired.

### Issue & PR Templates

* **Issue template**: Encourage clear bug reports or feature requests:

  * Title prefix: `[BUG]`, `[FEATURE]`, `[DOC]`.
  * Description: Expected behavior, actual behavior, minimal reproduction code.
* **PR template**: Checklist for authors:

  * [ ] Code follows style guidelines.
  * [ ] New tests added and passing.
  * [ ] Documentation/notebook updated.
  * [ ] Relevant issue linked.

Templates reside under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

### Code of Conduct

* A `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` in `.github/` defines community standards.
* Encourage respectful, inclusive collaboration.
* Clearly state reporting guidelines for unacceptable behavior.

### Contributor Recognition

* Contributor list reflected in README via a badge or link to GitHub contributors graph.
* Acknowledge significant contributions in the release notes or the acknowledgments section.
